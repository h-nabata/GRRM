Reaction path search data used in my article (titled as "ソフトウェア紹介「GRRMによる反応経路探索」") published in the January 2023 issue of "Ensemble", the journal of the Molecular Simulation Society of Japan (MSSJ).

Input files and calculation results (xxx_DC_list.log, xxx_EQ_list.log, xxx_PT_list.log, xxx_TS_list.log) for each SC-AFIR job are uploaded.

The jobs named "intermolecular..." is for an intermolecular reaction of cyclopentadiene and acrolein, and the jobs named "intramolecular..." is for an intramolecular reaction of 3-(cyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-yl)acrylaldehyde.

"scgo" and "sim" are words to describe the termination conditions of the SC-AFIR search. "scgo" stands for the SCGO option was used in the job, and "sim" stands for a kinetic navigation assisted by the RCMC method was used in the job.
